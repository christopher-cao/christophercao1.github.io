Passionate about the intersection of business and technology, I’ve had opportunities to not only develop my business acumen in international settings, but also cultivate my interest in computer science. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with and learn from mentors and teams from around the world. This website chronicles my journey as a developer and how it intersects with my experiences as an international business student. </p>

Out of curiosity, I registered for ITP 115: Introduction to Python to get an introduction to computer science. Little did I expect to enjoy the class so much, leading me to build a Pokemon battle simulator for the final project. </p>

              <p class="subtitle">I joined the university robotics team, where I had to make the difficult transition from developing in Python to C. Along with developing software in C and, eventually Python as well, I was elected to lead a team of 13 engineering students (software, mechanical, and electrical) from 4 nationalities to build a robot from scratch and compete in HKUST’s Robot Design competition. Our team won runner-up in the competition out of 10 teams. </p>
              <p class="subtitle">In addition to joining the robotics team, I was introduced to web development as a web development intern for the Grouptap, a group-based social networking platform based in Hong Kong, where I developed front-end functionality for the web application in Angular. As a Microsoft Student Partner, I also gained experience as a computer science instructor, developing and teaching a curriculum to pre-collegiate students in Hong Kong. </p>

This web application is now fully functional, in production, and used by over 400 users throughout the organization. Other than web development, perhaps the most important thing I learned from this project is how important it is to talk to users before and during development. The bulk of my time was spent gathering requirements and feedback from users across the value chain, including project managers, industrial engineers, and mechanical engineers. </p>
